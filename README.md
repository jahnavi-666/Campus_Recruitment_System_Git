It features secure login portals for each user type, real-time notifications, and eligibility filtering based on academic performance and skill sets. Additionally, it provides analytical dashboards for placement coordinators to track placement statistics and student engagement.By leveraging modern web technologies and database systems, the Campus Recruitment System enhances transparency, reduces administrative workload, and ensures efficient communication among all stakeholders. This system ultimately aims to improve the placement success rate and provide a better experience for both recruiters and students.
